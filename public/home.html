          <h1 class="blog-title">How life can change</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            It's surprising how life can change in a matter of seconds. Two
            years ago almost to the day. I was at my lowest point, I had a
            partner who was abusive, my dad had passed away and I was in a job
            that I hated. I was in a dark place and I didn't know how to get out
            of it. I ended up doing something I wasn't proud of and nearly
            checked out. Luckily I didn't and I'm here today. but what it did d
            was enable me to really discover who I really was. I reconnected
            with my now wife. I was diagnosed with ADHD, became medicated for
            it, was able to engage with therapy and realised how much I was
            repressing my true self it started the road to self discovery and
            acceptance. I'm now happy in myself able to express myself as a
            proud trans woman able to continue to watch my son grow into the
            amaxing person he is along side my wife. Now on a bootcamp to learn
            skills I have really clicked with in a way like never before. I'm
            happy and I'm proud of who I am. I'm not perfect but I'm me and
            that's all that matters. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to
            truly find yourself.
