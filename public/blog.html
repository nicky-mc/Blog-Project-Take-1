          It's surprising how life can change in a matter of seconds. Two years ago
            almost to the day. I was at my lowest point, I had a partner who was abusive, my dad had passed away and I was in a job that I hated. I was in a dark place and I didn't know how to get out of it. I ended up doing something I wasn't proud of and nearly checked out. Luckily I didn't and I'm here today. but what it did d was enable me to really discover who I really was. I reconnected with my now wife. I was diagnosed with ADHD, became medicated for it, was able to engage with therapy and realised how much I was repressing my true self it started the road to self discovery and acceptance. I'm now happy in myself able to express myself as a proud trans woman able to continue to watch my son grow into the amaxing person he is along side my wife. Now on a bootcamp to learn skills I have really clicked with in a way like never before. I'm happy and I'm proud of who I am. I'm not perfect but I'm me and that's all that matters. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to truly find yourself.
